#To access the HPC systems at your institution, you generally need an account which your HPC authority would create for you.
#Accessing HPC systems on campus

#Linux: To connect to the HPC from a Linux based computer, open a terminal window and simply type ssh hpc-login-node-name and then press enter.
ssh username@login-hostname

#Windows: To connect to the HPC from a computer using Microsoft Windows requires the use of a SSH client, e.g. PuTTY or MobaXterm.

#To generate an SSH keys, just use the ssh-keygen command, typically as follows:
ssh-keygen

#Next you should have sent through the account request form by mail and the public key (i.e. id_rsa.pub) to your HPC authority, enabling them to configure the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of your #account. Finally, to be able to use your SSH key in a public-key authentication scheme, it must be loaded by an SSH agent. Just execute the following:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

#Acessing HPC systems off campus
#Access to HPC systems at your institution from off-campus should be available for staffs and research students via some kinds of VPN services. If you do not know what is this - VPN stands for virtual #private network and is a type of network connection that allows users to access computer networks from anywhere in the world. It is also called IP tunneling, is a secure method of accessing your #institutionâ€™s computing resources such as HPC systems.

#There are various VPN clients that can you use to tunnel through a VPN. For example, the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility client is a web-based VPN client that does not require user configuration. You #generally download the client by pointing your browser to vpn.yourinstitution.edu. Alternatively, in a Linux environment, you can use free VPN clients like OpenVPN. On the Ubuntu or Debian systems, you #can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openvpn

#On CentOS/ RedHat systems you can enable the EPEL repositories and then install it by typing:
sudo yum install epel-release 
sudo yum install openvpn

#Finally on the Mac OSX systems you can use tools like Tunnelblick to create the IP tunnels.
